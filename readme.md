# Chrome Utilities

Small plug-in to which improvements will be added for the Chrome browser.

Several things to keep in mind:

This add-on is only valid for versions equal or superior to Chrome 84 in its final version.
The add-on has not been tested in beta or Canary versions.

This add-on only works on versions of NVDA 2019.3 and above.

## Improvement in read mode

Chrome itself doesn't bring this mode as if other browsers do.

If we want to have such a function we'll have to activate it before we can use it.

To activate this function we position ourselves in the address bar and type the following:

chrome://flags

We press enter and in the screen that leaves us in the search field Search flags we write the following:

reader mode

When we write it down we will hear that there is a result so we will tabulate until we hear the following:

-#enable-reader-mode 

So we tabulate once more and fall into a combo box by choosing the option Enable.

Now we tabulate again until the Relaunch button, we press it and the next time the browser restarts we'll have the read mode activated.

Well, when we enter a page that allows the reading mode, be careful, not all of them allow it. We can activate this mode to remove all the annoying things from the page in two ways:

1ยบ From the Chrome menu going up or down until we hear Activate/Deactivate reading mode and we will enter in reading mode, if in the menu there is no such option it means that the page we are in does not allow it.

2ยบ Once we are in the page, we can press F6 and two tabs to fall in a button that says Activate/Deactivate reading mode, if we press it we will enter in that mode. If this button doesn't appear, the page we are in doesn't allow it.

Well, although it seems little if we are a lot of using that reading mode, I missed a shortcut to enable or disable that mode or to warn me if the page does not allow it.

Well now with the plug-in if we press F9 we will activate the reading mode.

Well if the page we are in does not allow that mode we will be warned with a message.

If the page allows it, it will enter in reading mode, warning us that it is entering in this mode with a message.

If we press F9 while already in reading mode, it will exit and will also inform us that it is leaving that mode.
